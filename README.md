## Codecademy project -- mixed messages

Using Javascript design random messages. The messages should be split into 3 parts and *concatenate* together to make a message.

### Parameters of the project 

* The project needs to run on node.js
* I have decided to use jokes as the form of the radom messages.
* Version control needs to be used
* Also may make a simple HTML page for better user interface - but this would be extra to the project. 

#### To do list 

* Create and matain a gitHub version control for this project. 
* Maintain the REAME doc
* Create a js file and create the code:
    + Create 3 arrays containing strings for which can be put together in a random order. 
    + Create a function which calls a radom index from each of the arrays. 
    + concatenate the results from the arrays into one string 
    + log the string to the console
    + ***Extra*** - set up a simple HTML page with a button.
    + ***Extra*** link the js file to the page and get the js file to alter the HTML
*  Test code on node.js and chrome if extra steps are required.
