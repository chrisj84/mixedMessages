## Codecademy project -- mixed messages

Using Javascript design random messages. The messages should be split into 3 parts and *concatenate* together to make a message.

### Parameters of the project 

* The project needs to run on node.js
* I have decided to use jokes as the form of the radom messages.
* Version control needs to be used
* Also may make a simple HTML page for better user interface - but this would be extra to the project. 

### Updates 
 * Have started another branch *olive1*to try to redo the arrays
 * Have changed the subject of the messages from jokes to a dungeons and dragons theme. 
 * Have tested using node and is sucessfull, due to this will merge *olive1* branch to the master branch. 

#### To do list

    + concatenate the results from the arrays into one string :heavy_check_mark:
    + log the string to the console :heavy_check_mark:
    + ***Extra*** - set up a simple HTML page with a button.
